 <tr>
    <td class="spaceT">Software Architectures</td>
    <td>This was a very technical unit as i had to build a compiler using ANTLR which is great tool that i would consider using in the future, this tested my ability to
	understand designing at a theoretical level before even writing the code to implement the compiler.
the other part of the unit was comparing programming languages understanding the developers choice in design.
	</td>

   <tr>
    <td class="spaceT">Enterprise Programming</td>
    <td>In this unit i covered the Java EE platform feautures such as JPA, RMI, JMS .e.t.c all you will need for developing enterprise grade application. One of the assigment was to build a RESt and SOAP API that could parse json, xml, and plaintext. this proved a succesful unit for me as i achieved 86% in the exam. 
	</td>
  
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="spaceT">Final year project</td>
    <td>For my final year project i built an e learning website that taught the technique of Pixel Group Processing (Convolution Matrix), the objective was to make it interactive so there was alot of javascript involved. it can be found <a href="https://github.com/claudiga/PGP_Project" > here</a>.  
	</td>
  
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td  class="spaceT">Information andd Network Security </td>
    <td>I found this unit to be quite fun as it demonstrated offensive cyber securty aswell as how to defend against them when i had a case study of a company where i had to come up with a design of how to keep the network secure. On the offensive side i had to build a ransomeware in python i went full out on this assignment and even created a payment system on the Tor network using bitcoins less to say it was a fun unit. Which led me to coming as runner up for the competition on who can build the best ransomeware, I would share the code but i've already been warned by github that its not adviced here as its malicious</a>.
